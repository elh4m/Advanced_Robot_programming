# Advanced_Robot_programming
this repository includes 3 projects (first,second and third assignment) related to aforementioned course "advanced robot programming" by professor Zaccaria held in 2021 at the University of Genova,Italy.

#How to run the projects

1.Download and unzip the folder in your workspace.
2.open a linux based terminal like Ubuntu (becuase the project runs in real_time) then with "cd" command go inside of each source folder you prefer to run (it is easier to go inside the folder manually and right-click,select "open in a terminal" ,with this approach you do not need to type cd command several times) or do cd/path/to/your/executable once if you know the path by heart!!!.
3.compile the file with "gcc filename.c -o newfilename"
4.run/execute the file with "./newfilename
